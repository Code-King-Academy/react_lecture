## Introduction

This repository is part of the **Code King Academy Frontend Course** series. Here, we focus on React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. This course is designed to take you from beginner to advanced level in React, with practical examples and projects.

## Course Structure

The course is structured into multiple sections, each focusing on different aspects of React:

1. **Introduction to React**: Basics of React, components, JSX, and props.
2. **State Management**: Managing state with hooks like `useState` and `useReducer`.
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding the lifecycle of React components.
4. **Advanced Hooks**: Using advanced hooks like `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks.
5. **Routing**: Implementing routing in React using `react-router`.
6. **State Management Libraries**: Introduction to Redux and other state management libraries.
7. **API Integration**: Fetching data from APIs and handling asynchronous operations.
8. **Testing**: Writing tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
9. **Deployment**: Deploying React applications to various platforms.
